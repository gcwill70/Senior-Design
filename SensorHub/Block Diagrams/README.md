# Description
The hub diagram illustrates all the peripherals that the hub is connected to. The communication bus diagram shows how the hub and sensors are connected. Because it is possible for more than one sensor to be connected to the hub, RS485 support was added (results in only half-duplex communication, but that's okay for our design).
